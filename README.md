# ðŸ’¸ credit card transactions fraud detection
The goal of this project is to develop the best-performing model for detecting credit card fraud using machine learning techniques
1. Problem Statement

Credit card fraud is a serious issue that causes significant financial losses for both individuals and financial institutions. This type of fraud leads to billions of dollars in damages each year, and preventing it is critical for both customer security and the protection of banks' financial structures. Since credit card transactions are performed frequently and at high volumes by users, detecting fraudulent transactions through traditional methods has become quite challenging. At this point, machine learning algorithms and big data analytics provide an effective solution for the early detection and prevention of fraudulent activities.

Our dataset consists of credit card transactions made by users. In this project, I will examine the relevant dataset and develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions.

### 2. Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop the best-performing model for detecting credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. Specifically:

Fraud detection: To build a model that classifies whether the transactions in the dataset are legitimate or fraudulent.
Comparison of different models: Compare the performance of different machine learning models such as logistic regression, smote and random forrest.
Use of evaluation metrics: Instead of accuracy, evaluate the models using more meaningful metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC, considering class imbalance.
